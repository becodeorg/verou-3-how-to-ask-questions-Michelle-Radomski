# How to ask good questions: an introduction
## Tip 1: identify the problem
It's important you identify your problem first.  
Sometimes the terminal in your IDE can tell you what is wrong --> use this error.  
Other times you want your code to do something, but the result is not what you expected --> use keywords to identify the problem.  
Start over from a point where your code was still working. Sometimes we overlook simple syntax mistakes!
## Tip 2: Google
Google is your best friend :relieved:  
Seriously, search on Google first. Maybe you find the solution or part of it on another website!
## Tip 3: title
If tip 2 doesn't give you what you need, it's time to search for your bravery and face Stackoverflow to ask for help!  
Use words to connect those keywords together in a sentence to give a good idea about the problem in 1 sentence.  
ALWAYS tell which programming language you're using :grin:  
Same goes for a framework or library.  
## Tip 4: Introduce the problem
Now that you have a title, explain more in detail what the problem is. When does it occur? What do you want the code to do \(what's your goal\)? What did you try already to fix it yourself?  
Also, add a relevant code snippet so people know how your code looks like.
## In case you're at work
You can still repeat tip 1 - 4 in a work environment.  
To keep it short: 
- say what the problem is
- say what you want the code to do
- say what you already tried
- if possible, show a relevant code snippet
- keep it short and relevant
